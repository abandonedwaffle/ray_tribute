                <p class="name-text">Satyajit Ray was an Indian filmmaker, screenwriter, documentary filmmaker, author, essayist, lyricist, magazine editor, 
                illustrator, calligrapher, and music composer. Ray is widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. 
                He is celebrated for works such as The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959), The Music Room (1958), The Big City (1963) and Charulata (1964).
                Ray was born in Calcutta to renowned writer Sukumar Ray who was prominent in the field of arts and literature. Starting his career 
                as a commercial artist, he was drawn into independent filmmaking after meeting French filmmaker Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De 
                Sica's Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) during a visit to London.
